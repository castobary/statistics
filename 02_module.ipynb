    "# Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is any characteristics, number, or quantity that can be measured or counted. A variable may also be called a data item. Age, sex, business income and expenses, country of birth, capital expenditure, class grades, eye colour and vehicle type are examples of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables in statistics can describe either quantities, or qualities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the Height variable in our dataset describes how tall each player is. The Age variable describes how much time has passed since each player was born. The MIN variable describes how many minutes each player played in the 2016-2017 WNBA season.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, a variable that describes how much there is of something describes a quantity, and, for this reason, it's called a quantitative variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, quantitative variables describe a quantity using real numbers, but there are also cases when words are used instead. Height, for example, can be described using real numbers, like in our dataset, but it can also be described using labels like \"tall\" or \"short\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A few variables in our dataset clearly don't describe quantities. The Name variable, for instance, describes the name of each player. The Team variable describes what team each player belongs to. The College variable describes what college each player goes or went to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Name, Team, and College variables describe for each individual a quality, that is, a property that is not quantitative. Variables that describe qualities are called qualitative variables or categorical variables. Generally, qualitative variables describe what or how something is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, qualitative variables describe qualities using words, but numbers can also be used. For instance, the number of a player's shirt or the number of a racing car are described using numbers. The numbers don't bear any quantitative meaning though, they are just names, not quantities.\n",

We can immediately tell their performance is different, we know that athlete A finished faster, but we don't know how much faster. The difference between the two could be half a second, 12 minutes, half an hour, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other common examples include measurements of subjective evaluations that are generally difficult or near to impossible to quantify with precision. For instance, when answering a survey about how much they like a new product, people may have to choose a label between \"It's a disaster, I hate it\", \"I don't like it\", \"I like it a bit\", \"I really like it\", \"I simply love it\".\n",

    "The values of the variables measured on an ordinal scale can be both words and numbers. When the values are numbers, they are usually ranks.

    "\n",
    "Whether a variable is quantitative or qualitative is independent of the way the variable is measured. The Height variable, for instance, is quantitative no matter how we measure it. The fact that we use words like \"short\" or \"tall\" doesn't change its underlying nature. The Height variable still describes a magnitude, but in a different way."
