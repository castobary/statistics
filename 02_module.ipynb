    "# Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is any characteristics, number, or quantity that can be measured or counted. A variable may also be called a data item. Age, sex, business income and expenses, country of birth, capital expenditure, class grades, eye colour and vehicle type are examples of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables in statistics can describe either quantities, or qualities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the Height variable in our dataset describes how tall each player is. The Age variable describes how much time has passed since each player was born. The MIN variable describes how many minutes each player played in the 2016-2017 WNBA season.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, a variable that describes how much there is of something describes a quantity, and, for this reason, it's called a quantitative variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, quantitative variables describe a quantity using real numbers, but there are also cases when words are used instead. Height, for example, can be described using real numbers, like in our dataset, but it can also be described using labels like \"tall\" or \"short\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A few variables in our dataset clearly don't describe quantities. The Name variable, for instance, describes the name of each player. The Team variable describes what team each player belongs to. The College variable describes what college each player goes or went to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Name, Team, and College variables describe for each individual a quality, that is, a property that is not quantitative. Variables that describe qualities are called qualitative variables or categorical variables. Generally, qualitative variables describe what or how something is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, qualitative variables describe qualities using words, but numbers can also be used. For instance, the number of a player's shirt or the number of a racing car are described using numbers. The numbers don't bear any quantitative meaning though, they are just names, not quantities.\n",

    "\n",
    "The amount of information a variable provides depends on its nature (whether it's quantitative or qualitative), and on the way it's measured.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can tell whether or not two individuals are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there's a difference:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ We can tell the size of the difference. If player A has 190 cm and player B has 192 cm, then the difference between the two is 2 cm.\n",
    "+ We can tell the direction of the difference from each perspective: player A has 2 cm less than player B, and player B has 2 cm more than player A.\n",
